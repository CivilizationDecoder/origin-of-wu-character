首次提交：关于汉字“午”本源的革命性假说
本研究提出并论证：汉字“午”源于华夏先民对苍龙星宿（心宿二、角宿）的符号化表达。其甲骨文之“柔”为星图，金文之“刚”为图腾，形态演变实录了从“祈天降临”到“法天飞升”的精神史诗。此假说一举破解“杵臼说”与“绳索说”的千年对立，并为“端午”、“午门”等核心文化制度提供了终极解释。本文为“华夏文明源代码”系列研究的开篇基石。

Initial Commit: A Revolutionary Hypothesis on the Origin of Chinese Character "Wu"
This study proposes and argues that the Chinese character "Wu" (午) originated as a symbolic representation of the Azure Dragon constellation (Antares, Jiao Su) in ancient Chinese astronomy. Its "pliable" form in oracle bone script depicts the star map, while its "rigid" form in bronze inscriptions embodies the totem. This morphological evolution records a spiritual epic from "praying for celestial descent" to "emulating heavenly ascent." This hypothesis resolves the millennia-old dispute between the "mortar" and "rope" theories and provides the ultimate explanation for core cultural institutions like the Dragon Boat Festival ("Duanwu") and the Meridian Gate ("Wumen"). This paper serves as the foundational stone for the "Source Code of Huaxia Civilization" research series.
